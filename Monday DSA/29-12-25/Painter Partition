Divide an array into A continuous parts such that the maximum sum of any part is minimized. Then multiply that max length by B.

- Minimize the maximum workload when splitting into A contiguous groups.
- we use binary search to find wat is the minimum upper limit of no of boards a single painter paints
- canPaint checks if <=A painters will be needed to paint the boards if max boards a painter can paint is x

def canPaint(C, A, maxLen):
    painters = 1
    curr = 0
    for board in C:
        if curr + board <= maxLen:
            curr += board
        else:
            painters += 1
            curr = board
            if painters > A:
                return False
    return True

def minTime(A, B, C):
    MOD = 10000003
    low = max(C)
    high = sum(C)
    ans = high
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if canPaint(C, A, mid):
            ans = mid
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return (ans * B) % MOD
